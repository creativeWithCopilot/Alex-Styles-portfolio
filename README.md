structure → styling → interactivity → optimization → responsiveness → accessibility, ensuring the site evolved into a professional, inclusive, and user‑friendly portfolio

1. Initial Structure
I provided a semantic HTML skeleton with clear sections (About Me, Portfolio, Contact) and placeholders for content.

Ensured the markup was clean, modular, and ready for styling.

2. Styling Foundation
I created a starter CSS file defining typography, color scheme, and layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Introduced brand variables (--color-primary, --font-heading, etc.) for consistency and maintainability.

3. Advanced Interactivity
Added hover transitions for links and buttons to make interactions feel smooth.

Implemented fade‑in animations for portfolio thumbnails with staggered delays for a polished reveal.

4. Performance Optimization
Consolidated redundant styles and introduced CSS variables to reduce repetition.

Organized the stylesheet into logical sections (Base, Navigation, Portfolio, Contact, Footer, Animations).

5. Responsive Design
Wrote media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

Adjusted font sizes for readability and restructured the portfolio grid and contact form to adapt across devices.

6. Accessibility Enhancements
Updated HTML with ARIA roles, labels, and alt text for screen readers.

Added a skip link for keyboard navigation and clear focus outlines for interactive elements.

Ensured form fields were properly labeled and marked as required.
